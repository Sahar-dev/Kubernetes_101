## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this guide, we'll deploy two Django applications:

-   **Service A**: Provides an API endpoint that returns data.
-   **Service B**: Consumes the API from Service A and displays the data.

Our focus will be on how to configure and deploy these applications on Kubernetes, understanding each component involved.

 

## Prerequisites

-   **Basic Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes**: Understanding of containers and orchestration.
-   **Docker Installed**: To containerize the applications.
-   **Kubernetes Cluster**: You can use Minikube for local development.
-   **kubectl Command-line Tool**: To interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
-   **Python 3.6+ and Django Installed**: For setting up the applications.
 

## Setting Up the Django Applications

We'll briefly set up the two Django applications. Detailed Django setup instructions are available in the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/).

### Service A: API Service

-   **Create a Django project and app**: Initialize a new Django project called `service_a_project` and an app called `api_app`.
-   **Implement a simple API view**: Create a view that returns JSON data (e.g., a list of items).
-   **Configure URLs**: Map a URL path to the API view.
-   **Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: In `settings.py`, set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` for development purposes.

### Service B: Web Service

-   **Create a Django project and app**: Initialize a new Django project called `service_b_project` and an app called `web_app`.
-   **Implement a view that consumes Service A**: Use Python's `requests` library to fetch data from Service A's API.
-   **Configure URLs and Templates**: Map a URL path to the view and create a template to display the data.
-   **Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`**: In `settings.py`, set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` for development purposes.
 

## Containerizing the Applications with Docker

Containerizing the applications ensures they run consistently across different environments.

### Writing Dockerfiles

**Service A Dockerfile**

```
FROM python:3.9-slim 
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install django
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

**Service B Dockerfile**

```
FROM python:3.9-slim 
WORKDIR /app 
COPY . . 
RUN pip install django requests 
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

-   **Explanation**:
    -   `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
    -   `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container.
    -   `COPY`: Copies application code into the container.
    -   `RUN`: Executes commands during the image build (e.g., installing dependencies).
    -   `CMD`: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
 

## Pushing Docker Images to a Registry

-   **Build the Docker images**:

    `docker build -t your_username/service-a:latest ./service_a
    docker build -t your_username/service-b:latest ./service_b`

-   **Push the images to Docker Hub** (or your chosen registry):

    `docker push your_username/service-a:latest
    docker push your_username/service-b:latest`

 

## Understanding Kubernetes Architecture and Components

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, orchestrates the deployment and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. Its architecture is designed to handle scaling, self-healing, and efficient resource utilization.

### Core Components
<p><img src="https://www.armosec.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Picture1.png"></p>

1.  **Master Node (Control Plane)**
    -   **API Server**: Acts as the communication hub for the Kubernetes cluster, exposing the Kubernetes API.
    -   **Controller Manager**: Ensures the desired state of the cluster by managing controllers such as Deployments and Replicas.
    -   **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to available nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
    -   **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster configuration and state data.
2.  **Worker Nodes**
    -   **Kubelet**: Ensures that containers are running in a pod. Communicates with the API server for instructions.
    -   **Kube Proxy**: Handles networking for pods, managing access to services inside and outside the cluster.
    -   **Container Runtime**: Responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
3.  **Pods**
    -   The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more tightly coupled containers.
4.  **Services**
    -   A stable endpoint to expose a group of pods, enabling communication between components or with external systems.
5.  **ConfigMaps and Secrets**
    -   **ConfigMaps**: Manage configuration data in key-value pairs.
    -   **Secrets**: Store sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, securely.

### High-Level Workflow

-   **User Interaction**: Users interact with the cluster using `kubectl` or APIs.
-   **Control Plane Processing**: The API server validates requests and updates `etcd`. The scheduler and controllers work together to match resources with the desired state.
-   **Pod Deployment**: Pods are scheduled on worker nodes, where Kubelet and the container runtime take over.
-   **Networking**: Services and Kube Proxy handle communication between pods and external systems.

 

## Writing Kubernetes YAML Configuration Files

### Service A Kubernetes Configuration

**1\. Deployment for Service A**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: service-a-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service-a
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: service-a
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: service-a
          image: your_username/service-a:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000

```
-   **Explanation**:
    -   `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`: Define the resource type and metadata.
    -   `spec.replicas`: Specifies the desired number of pod replicas.
    -   `spec.selector.matchLabels`: Matches pods with the specified labels.
    -   `spec.template`: Defines the pod template.
    -   `spec.template.spec.containers`: Specifies the containers within the pod.
**2\. Service for Service A**

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-a
spec:
  selector:
    app: service-a
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000
      targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP
```

-   **Explanation**:
    -   `spec.selector`: Selects pods with the label `app: service-a`.
    -   `spec.ports`: Defines the ports exposed by the service.

### Service B Kubernetes Configuration

**1\. Deployment for Service B**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: service-b-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service-b
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: service-b
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: service-b
          image: your_username/service-b:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8000
          env:
            - name: SERVICE_A_HOST
              value: "service-a"
```
-   **Explanation**:
    -   `env`: Sets environment variables inside the container, allowing Service B to locate Service A using the Kubernetes service name.
**2\. Service for Service B**


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-b
spec:
  selector:
    app: service-b
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8000
      targetPort: 8000
```
 

## Deploying Applications to Kubernetes

### 1\. Start Your Kubernetes Cluster

If you're using Minikube:

`minikube start`

### 2\. Apply the Configuration Files


`kubectl apply -f service_a_k8s.yaml kubectl apply -f service_b_k8s.yaml`

-   **Explanation**:
    -   `kubectl apply`: Applies the configuration to the cluster, creating or updating resources.

### 3\. Verify the Deployments and Services

`kubectl get deployments kubectl get pods kubectl get services`

-   **Explanation**:
    -   `kubectl get`: Lists resources in your cluster.
 

## Testing the Deployment

### Accessing Service B

Since the services are only accessible within the cluster, we'll use port forwarding to access Service B from our local machine.

`kubectl port-forward service/service-b 8001:8000`

-   **Explanation**:
    -   `kubectl port-forward`: Forwards one or more local ports to a pod.

### Viewing the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001/` to see the data fetched from Service A.

 

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS` Error

**Problem**: Service A raises an `Invalid HTTP_HOST` error when accessed by Service B.

**Solution**:

1.  **Update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` of Service A**:

    `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['service-a']`

    -   **Explanation**: In Kubernetes, services communicate using service names. Adding `'service-a'` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` allows Django to accept requests addressed to `service-a`.
    -   
2.  **Rebuild and Push the Updated Docker Image**:

    `docker build -t your_username/service-a:latest ./service_a docker push your_username/service-a:latest`

3.  **Update the Deployment in Kubernetes**:

    Since the image tag is the same, you might need to force Kubernetes to pull the latest image by deleting the existing pod:

    `kubectl delete pod -l app=service-a`

    Or update the deployment to use an image tag with a version number (e.g., `:v2`) to ensure Kubernetes pulls the new image.

 

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've deployed two intercommunicating Django applications on Kubernetes. By focusing on the Kubernetes YAML configuration files and understanding how Kubernetes works, you now have a solid foundation for deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
